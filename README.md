**Bug Reporting**

I currently do not accept bug/issue reports at the moment as the program is still under major development. The source code may receieve dramatic changes within short period of time. It is not possible to trace and fix every bug in this everchanging codebase.

When this program has reached a stable state (most features are implmented, no major changes will be made to the code), I welcome all bug reports.
